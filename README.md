# #50million
Definitely not a master piece of web application, however I needed a way to understand how many users were affected by the data breach by end of September 2018 at Facebook (https://www.bbc.com/news/amp/technology-45686890) you hear of new breaches, it's millions here and there. 
With the help of https://randomuser.me I found a way of adding faces and profiles to each and every one of those users. With the help of emojis I am visualising how many 50.000.000 profiles really are. Click on any of the emoticons and you will be provided with a profile.

Initially, 750 icons are displayed - however, one can opt for showing more - a huge amount of personal data. 
Luckily I am not affected by this hack as I have left Facebook years ago, as I strongly distrust the company to work with my data in a responsible way. 
Feel free to fork this idea, as there are plenty of other current and future incidents of compromised profiles - just follow https://haveibeenpwned.com - and remember - each profile is a real person with his/her own history.
