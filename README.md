# #50million
Definitely not a master piece of web application, however I needed a way to understand how many users were affected by the data breach by end of September 2018 at Facebook (https://www.bbc.com/news/amp/technology-45686890) you hear of new breaches, it's millions here and there. 
With the help of https://randomuser.me I found a way of adding faces and profiles to each and every one of those users. With the help of emojis I am visualising how many 50.000.000 profiles really are. Click on any of the emoticons and you will be provided with a profile. And it's always the same profile, given the "seed" option of randomuser.me. 
A user gets prompted how many profiles he want to see per page, as while testing, already 500.000 profiles were pushing my browser and laptop to the limit. I did not want to try 100 times this amount, as this is exactly 50.000.000. In the end - a huge amount of personal data. 
Currently, the request to randomuser.me is only trackable in the console, but I will work on showing the profile details at a later time.
